# Tridactyl - Lướt web bằng bàn phím giống Vimium
## Highlighted features:​

- f/F — enter the "hint mode" to select a link to follow. F to open it in a background tab. (Note: hint characters should be typed in lowercase.)
- Shift + Insert or Ctrl-Alt-Escape — enter "ignore mode" to send all key presses to the web page you are on. Press Shift + Insert or Ctrl-Alt-Escape again to return to the highly productive "normal mode".
- H/L — go back/forward in the history.
- o/O — open a URL in this tab (O to pre-load current URL).
- t/T — open a URL in a new tab (T to pre-load current URL).
- gt/gT — go to the next/previous tab.
- d — close the current tab.
- <C-,> — "escape hatch": get to a place where you can use Tridactyl. Works anywhere in the browser.
- / — open the find search box. Use ctrl + g/G to cycle through search results.
- b — bring up a list of open tabs in the current window.
- s — if you want to search for something that looks like a domain name or URL.
- gi — scroll to and focus the last-used input on the page.
- gr — open Firefox reader mode (note: Tridactyl will not work in this mode).
- Bind your own commands with, e.g., :bind J tabprev. Type :help bind to see help on custom binds.
- yy — copy the current page URL to your clipboard.
- [[/]] — navigate forward/backward though paginated pages.
- ZZ — close all tabs and windows, but it will only "save" them if your about![:p](https://statics.voz.tech/styles/next/xenforo/smilies/popo/tongue.png?v=01 "Stick out tongue    :p")references are set to "show your tabs and windows from last time".
- <C-v> – send a single keystroke to the current website, bypassing bindings by entering ignore mode temporarily
